# The World's Gold

How big is all the gold ever mined? Let's find out using material densities.

## Total Gold Mined

Estimates suggest about 200,000 tonnes of gold have been mined throughout history:

```
total_gold = 200000 to 210000 tonne
```

## Volume Calculation

Using gold's density:

```
gold_volume = total_gold / rho_gold
```

All the gold ever mined has a volume of about **${gold_volume}**.

## The Golden Cube

If we formed it into a cube:

```
cube_side = gold_volume^(1/3)
cube_side_m = cube_side as m
```

The cube would be about **${cube_side_m}** on each side - roughly the size of a tennis court!

## Comparison with Other Materials

If we had the same mass of other materials, how big would they be?

```
steel_volume = total_gold / rho_steel
aluminum_volume = total_gold / rho_aluminum
wood_volume = total_gold / rho_wood

steel_cube = steel_volume^(1/3) as m
aluminum_cube = aluminum_volume^(1/3) as m
wood_cube = wood_volume^(1/3) as m
```

Same mass would give us:
- Steel cube: **${steel_cube}** per side
- Aluminum cube: **${aluminum_cube}** per side
- Wood cube: **${wood_cube}** per side

## Density Comparisons

How do common materials compare?

```
gold_to_water = rho_gold / rho_water
steel_to_aluminum = rho_steel / rho_aluminum
ice_floats = rho_ice / rho_water
```

- Gold is **${gold_to_water}x** denser than water
- Steel is **${steel_to_aluminum}x** denser than aluminum
- Ice density ratio to water: **${ice_floats}** (that's why it floats!)

## Olympic Swimming Pool of Gold

An Olympic pool is 50m x 25m x 2m:

```
pool_volume = 50 m * 25 m * 2 m
pool_of_gold = pool_volume * rho_gold
```

A swimming pool filled with gold would weigh **${pool_of_gold}** - about 2.5x all the gold ever mined!
