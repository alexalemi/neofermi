# How Many Times Does Your Heart Beat in a Lifetime?

A simple but profound Fermi problem.

## Heart Rate

```
# Average resting heart rate (beats per minute)
resting_bpm = 60 to 80

# Average over a day (sleeping is lower, exercise is higher)
average_bpm = 70 to 80
```

## Lifetime

```
# Expected lifespan
lifespan = human_lifespan

# Convert to minutes
minutes_in_lifetime = lifespan * days_per_year * minutes_per_day
```

## Calculation

```
# Total heartbeats
total_heartbeats = average_bpm * minutes_in_lifetime
```

## Result

Your heart beats approximately **${total_heartbeats}** times in a lifetime.

That's roughly 2.5-3 billion heartbeats!

## Interesting Comparison

```
# Heartbeats per day
beats_per_day = average_bpm * minutes_per_day
```

Your heart beats about ${beats_per_day} times per day - roughly 100,000 times!
